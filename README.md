# Tip Calculator for Swedes
A big question I often get from my swedish friends when they are traveling to the USA is... 
How do we know how much to tip at a returant?
As a former bartendar I feel that tipping is more a feeling than a number. This calulator not only uses math
to help give you a solution, but helps you decided how you feel about the pertcetage of the bill you are leaving. 
Also, why you are leaving a tip at all...

## UX
The user of this application needs clarity of why and how to leave a tip to a server in an American resturant.
This application uses a wizard to navigate a user through each step easily so they are not overwelmed. 

### User Stories
In Sweden we do not tip, so why do I need to leave a tip when I travel to America?

As a tourist in the US I know I need to tip, but I often get confused how much...
When traveling on business I need a calulator that can seperate the bill.
