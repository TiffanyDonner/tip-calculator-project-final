# Tip Calculator for Swedes
A big question I often get from my Swedish friends when they are traveling to the USA is... 
How do we know how much to tip at a restaurant?
As a former bartender, I feel that tipping is more of a feeling than a number. This calculator not only uses math
to help give you a solution but helps you decided how you feel about the percentage of the bill you are leaving. 
Also, why you are leaving a tip at all...

## UX
The user of this application needs clarity of why and how to leave a tip to a server in an American restaurant.
This application allows the user quick access and utilizes a wizard workflow to navigate a user through each step easily so they are not overwhelmed. For the experience for the user the application will be in Swedish, however 
for this project, it will be displayed in English.

### User Stories
In Sweden we do not tip, so why do I need to leave a tip when I travel to America?
